## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| **Composition engine complexity** | Start with V1 (explicit only), add V2 incrementally |
| **Scope creep** | Stick to MVP features, defer nice-to-haves |
| **Performance issues** | Early load testing, optimize queries, add indexes |
| **Multi-tenant data leaks** | Comprehensive permission tests, middleware coverage |
| **Deployment issues** | Test full stack locally with production config |
